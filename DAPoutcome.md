# DAP status influences on outcomes

* Individuals have a DAP attribute, assigned to be "DAP active" for upon successful DAP enrollment
* ADAP: 
    - Individuals who were originally assigned to be in trajectory 2 (test, never treated) could change to trajectory 3 (treated, partial suppression) or 4 (treated, full suppression) if ADAP active
    - ADAP active have higher probability of (re)initiating ART
    - ADAP active have lower probability of discontinuing ART 
* PrEP-DAP: 
    - PrEP-DAP active are more likely to initiate PrEP
    - Question: would PrEP-DAP clients behave differently than individuals who are on PrEP but not enrolled in PrEP-DAP?
    - Possible behaviors that may be influenced by PrEP-DAP enrollment:
        + discontinuation
        + adherence to PrEP
        + frequency of HIV/STI testing
