# Objective

* The objective of WHAMP is to develop a simulation model of HIV in the state of Washington that can evaluate budget allocation questions related to drug assistance programs for HIV treatment (ART) and prevention (PrEP). 
* Important features of these drug assistance programs include eligibility criteria, enrollment process, and benefits package (primarily paying client medical expenditures for covered services).
* Modified the `EpiModelHIV` package (branch `prep-race`) to incoporate the need of cost evaluation for the two programs. 
* Features added to `EpiModelHIV` platform: 
    - Costs paid by drug assistance program
    - Insurance/income characteristics of individuals
