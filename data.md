# Data sources

## Program Dynamics

For both ADAP and PrEP modules, we will use client-level data from the Washington State Department of Health to determine DAP program dynamics and costs. Examples of necessary parameters include:

- probability of enrollment
- probability of recertification
- cost of services

## Program Outcomes

How to quantify the program outcomes is still an open question, because we have access to data on people enrolled in the program but not necessarily those not enrolled in the program. Possibilities include:

- assumption
- using a larger database of people engaged in care (to estimate effects of ADAP, specifically)
- expert opinion from WADOH people
- literature search
