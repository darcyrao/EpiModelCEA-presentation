# Data sources

The data sources to inform parameters are as follows:

1. Seattle Pride Survey
     - Population: MSM at Pride Parade
     - Data Collection Methods: 
     - Availability: Summary available in Washington HIV-AIDS annual epidemiology report, pp. 46-50 [link](https://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/health/communicable-diseases/hiv-std/patients/epidemiology/~/media/depts/health/communicable-diseases/documents/hivstd/2016-hiv-aids-epidemiology-annual-report.ashx)
2. Washington PrEP DAP Client Survey

     - Availability: [Summary available](https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/5620/WashingtonHIVPreventionProjectKeyFindings2017.pdf). More available from WADOH, if needed?
5. Washington State Department of Health data for ADAP and PrEP-DAP
     - Population: All ADAP and PrEP-DAP clients
     - Data Collection Methods: Medical and care coordination appointments.
     - Availability: Client-level anonymized data is being provided to us by WADOH. 


# Parameters 
## Demographics

Key demographic information include income, insurance status (by income), and insurance provider (by income), all stratified by race (black/white). We will be able to get this information from ARTNET (3) and compare it to WAHPP (4).

## Drug Assistance Program Dynamics

For both ADAP and PrEP modules, we will use the WADOH data (5) to determine DAP program dynamics and costs. Examples of necessary parameters include:

- probability of enrollment. This could be calculated from how many people enroll and who enrolls (that is, the demographics of clients). One option is to maintain a fixed program size (which could change over time) and enroll people to maintain that program size.
- probability of recertification.
- cost of services, subdivided by HIV-related and other medical (ADAP), and PrEP drug costs and nondrug costs (PrEP)


## Drug Assistance Program Outcomes

How to quantify the program outcomes is still an open question, because we have access to data on people enrolled in the programs but not necessarily those not enrolled in the programs. Possibilities include:

- analysis of or extrapolation from statewide surveys (3, 4)
- assumption
- using a larger database of people engaged in care (to estimate effects of ADAP, specifically)
- expert opinion from WADOH people
- literature search
